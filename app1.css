/*Exercice 
Hipster Logo Exercise

I'm opening up a very hip artisanal vodka company called Purple Grain. Please help complete my incredibly ugly logo. Style the <h1> with the following styles:

    uppercase all the letters, without touching the html! (note: you weren't taught how to do this, you will need to flex your googling skills)

    set the font-family to be 'monospace'

    center align the text

    set the font weight to 100

    make the text size 40px

    set spacing between letters to 20px

    add a wavy plum underline (plum is the color) - I can't test this, but make sure it looks like the image!
